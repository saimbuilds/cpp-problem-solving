## 🔥 KEY CONCEPTS TO MASTER

### Arrays
1. **Size calculation:** `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])`
2. **Prefix sum:** O(1) range queries
3. **Kadane's algorithm:** Maximum subarray sum
4. **Two pointers:** Efficient searching/manipulation
5. **Spiral traversal:** Interview favorite

### Functions
1. **Pass by reference:** Modify original variables
2. **Array parameters:** Always passed by reference
3. **2D array parameters:** Must specify column size
4. **Function overloading:** Same name, different parameters
5. **Const parameters:** Prevent modification

### Recursion
1. **Always have base case:** Prevent infinite recursion
2. **Make progress:** Each call should move toward base case
3. **Memoization:** Cache results for efficiency
4. **Backtracking:** Explore all possibilities
5. **Recursion tree:** Visualize execution

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Array index out of bounds** - Always check `i < n`
2. **Infinite recursion** - Missing base case
3. **Uninitialized arrays** - Use `{0}` to initialize
4. **Wrong 2D parameter** - Must specify column size
5. **Integer overflow** - Use `long long` for large values
6. **Modifying array in loop** - Can cause unexpected behavior
7. **Not testing edge cases** - Empty, single element, all same

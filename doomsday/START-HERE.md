## 💪 MINDSET FOR TONIGHT

**Don't try to learn everything.**  
**Just patterns. Just logic. Just cram.**

You have:
- ✅ Built a 4765-line game (you CAN code)
- ✅ 6.5 hours to cram patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive materials (this folder)
- ✅ Focused plan (BATTLE-PLAN)

**You're not starting from zero.**  
**You're refreshing what you already know.**

---

## 🚨 WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Don't read all files tonight (overwhelming)  
❌ Don't try to memorize word-for-word  
❌ Don't stay up past midnight (need sleep)  
❌ Don't panic about what you don't know  
❌ Don't check social media (distraction)

✅ DO: Read ULTIMATE-CHEAT-SHEET  
✅ DO: Write patterns by hand  
✅ DO: Read PROJECT-PATTERNS  
✅ DO: Sleep by 12:30 AM  

---

## 📊 SUCCESS PROBABILITY

If you follow the plan:
- **70-85% score:** Highly probable ✅
- **Pass comfortably:** Almost certain ✅
- **Top performance:** Possible if you execute well 🎯

Why?
1. You already coded a complex game
2. Materials cover all patterns
3. 6.5 hours is enough for cramming
4. Pattern recognition > deep theory

## ❓ QUICK FAQ

**Q: Should I read BATTLE-PLAN first?**  
A: Skim it (10 min), then start ULTIMATE-CHEAT-SHEET

**Q: What if I don't finish all materials?**  
A: Focus on ULTIMATE-CHEAT-SHEET. That's the core.

**Q: Should I practice coding on computer?**  
A: NO. Paper only. Exam is on paper.

**Q: What if I'm too stressed to start?**  
A: Take 3 deep breaths. Start with page 1. One step at a time.

**Q: Can I skip tonight and just study tomorrow?**  
A: NO. Tonight builds foundation. Tomorrow is practice.

│   not perfect memorization.                  │
│                                              │
│   Your job: See matrix → Think "spiral"      │
│             See recursion → Think "base case"│
│             See 2D array → Think "transpose" │
│                                              │
│   You already know how to code.              │
│   Now just cram the patterns.                │
│                                              │

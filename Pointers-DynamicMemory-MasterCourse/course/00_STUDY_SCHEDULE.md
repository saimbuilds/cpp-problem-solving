## Rules for Maximum Efficiency
1. **No distractions** - Phone off, focus mode
2. **Stick to time blocks** - Move on even if not 100% clear
3. **Write by hand** - Trace dry runs on paper
4. **Speed matters** - In exams, you need both accuracy AND speed
5. **Mark difficult concepts** - Revise in Hour 11

🎯 **Remember**: You're not just learning. You're preparing to dominate.

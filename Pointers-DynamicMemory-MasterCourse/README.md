## 🎓 Study Tips

### How to Use This Course

1. **Follow the schedule** - It's designed for optimal learning
2. **Do problems by hand** - In exams, you write code on paper
3. **Don't skip practice** - Theory without practice = failure
4. **Time yourself** - Speed matters in exams
5. **Mark difficult topics** - Revisit in Hour 11

### During Study Sessions

✅ **DO:**
- Focus completely (no phone!)
- Write dry runs on paper
- Attempt problems before seeing solutions
- Take short breaks between hours
- Track time spent on each section

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip straight to solutions
- Just read without practicing
- Multitask
- Rush through modules
- Skip the fundamentals
